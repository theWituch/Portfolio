# Portfolio

This project contains application built in VueJS for my personal portfolio purposes.

I use it to practice creating applications in Vue and at the same time to present my skills and experience.

The latest released version is accessible at https://thewituch.netlify.app/.


## Getting Started

First, just clone this repository. You will need an instance of [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed for the following steps.

### Project setup

A freshly downloaded project requires the installation of the libraries used in it, so run:
```
npm install
```

When the installation process is complete, the project is ready to run. Command bellow starts development server which compiles and hot-reloads for development:
```
npm run serve
```

When everything is ready, the project should be compiled to a minimalist version ready to be placed on the server:
```
npm run build
```
