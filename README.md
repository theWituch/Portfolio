# Portfolio

This project contains application built in VueJS for my personal portfolio purposes.

I use it to practice creating applications in Vue and at the same time to present my skills and experience.

The latest released version is accessible at https://thewituch.netlify.app/.

## Few words about

The original plan for creating this portfolio was to go through the full process - from design in Figma to application development.\
However, I decided to let go of the design process (lack of inspiration) and proceed directly to the implementation process.

As a website design, I used a ready-made theme (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page270/marvel) from the Internet and treated it as a visual guideline on how the target product should look like and behave.

I wrote the entire application in VueJS **myself from scratch.**

## Getting Started

First, just clone this repository. You will need an instance of [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed for the following steps.

### Project setup

A freshly downloaded project requires the installation of the libraries used in it, so run:
```
npm install
```

When the installation process is complete, the project is ready to run. Command bellow starts development server which compiles and hot-reloads for development:
```
npm run serve
```

When everything is ready, the project should be compiled to a minimalist version ready to be placed on the server:
```
npm run build
```
